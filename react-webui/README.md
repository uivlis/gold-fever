> :herb: This is the webui workspaces :octocat: All you need in a nut:shell:

This template is a react webapp, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This basic example is written is typescript.

## Installation

Use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install dependencies.

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Usage

Before running this webapp, you must have deployed the contracts to some network.

### All available commands

The package.json file contains a set of npm scripts to help on the development phase. Below is a short description for each
* **"eject"** read below*
* **"start"** runs the app in the development mode
* **"build"** builds the app for production to the `build` folder
* **"test"** run tests locally
* **"test:ci"** run tests in CI system
* **"coverage"** run coverage locally
* **"coverage:ci"** run coverage in CI system
* **"lint"** lint source and tests typecript code
* **"docs"** generates documentation based in your comments on the source code

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
